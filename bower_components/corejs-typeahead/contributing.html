<h2 id="Project-Status"><a href="#Project-Status" class="headerlink" title="Project Status"></a>Project Status</h2><p>The maintainers of this project welcome Pull Requests but, due to a lack of<br>time, new major feature requests are unlikely to be taken on.</p>
<p>Looking to contribute something to typeahead.js? Here’s how you can help.</p>
<h2 id="Bugs-Reports"><a href="#Bugs-Reports" class="headerlink" title="Bugs Reports"></a>Bugs Reports</h2><p>A bug is a <em>demonstrable problem</em> that is caused by the code in the<br>repository. Good bug reports are extremely helpful – thank you!</p>
<p>Guidelines for bug reports:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Use the GitHub issue search</strong> &mdash; check if the issue has already been<br>reported.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Check if the issue has been fixed</strong> &mdash; try to reproduce it using the<br>latest <code>master</code> or integration branch in the repository.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Isolate the problem</strong> &mdash; ideally create a reduced test<br>case and a live example.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Please try to be as detailed as possible in your report. Include specific<br>information about the environment – operating system and version, browser<br>and version, version of typeahead.js – and steps required to reproduce the<br>issue.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="Feature-Requests-amp-Contribution-Enquiries"><a href="#Feature-Requests-amp-Contribution-Enquiries" class="headerlink" title="Feature Requests &amp; Contribution Enquiries"></a>Feature Requests &amp; Contribution Enquiries</h2><p>Feature requests are welcome. But take a moment to find out whether your idea<br>fits with the scope and aims of the project. It’s up to <em>you</em> to make a strong<br>case for the inclusion of your feature. Please provide as much detail and<br>context as possible.</p>
<p>Contribution enquiries should take place before any significant pull request,<br>otherwise you risk spending a lot of time working on something that we might<br>have good reasons for rejecting.</p>
<h2 id="Pull-Requests"><a href="#Pull-Requests" class="headerlink" title="Pull Requests"></a>Pull Requests</h2><p>Good pull requests – patches, improvements, new features – are a fantastic<br>help. They should remain focused in scope and avoid containing unrelated<br>commits.</p>
<p>Make sure to adhere to the coding conventions used throughout the codebase<br>(indentation, accurate comments, etc.) and any other requirements (such as test<br>coverage).</p>
<p>Please follow this process; it’s the best way to get your work included in the<br>project:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><a href="http://help.github.com/fork-a-repo/" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Fork</a> the project, clone your fork,<br>and configure the remotes:</p>
<pre><code class="bash"><span class="comment"># Clone your fork of the repo into the current directory</span>
git <span class="built_in">clone</span> https://github.com/&lt;your-username&gt;/typeahead.js
<span class="comment"># Navigate to the newly cloned directory</span>
<span class="built_in">cd</span> &lt;repo-name&gt;
<span class="comment"># Assign the original repo to a remote called "upstream"</span>
git remote add upstream git://github.com/twitter/typeahead.js
</code></pre>
</li>
<li><p>If you cloned a while ago, get the latest changes from upstream:</p>
<pre><code class="bash">git checkout master
git pull upstream master
</code></pre>
</li>
<li><p>Install the dependencies (you must have Node.js and <a href="http://bower.io" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Bower</a><br>installed), and create a new topic branch (off the main project development<br>branch) to contain your feature, change, or fix:</p>
<pre><code class="bash">npm install
bower install
git checkout -b &lt;topic-branch-name&gt;
</code></pre>
</li>
<li><p>Make sure to update, or add to the tests when appropriate. Patches and<br>features will not be accepted without tests. Run <code>npm test</code> to check that<br>all tests pass after you’ve made changes.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Commit your changes in logical chunks. Provide clear and explanatory commit<br>messages. Use Git’s <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/interactive-rebase" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">interactive rebase</a> feature to tidy up<br>your commits before making them public.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Locally merge (or rebase) the upstream development branch into your topic branch:</p>
<pre><code class="bash">git pull [--rebase] upstream master
</code></pre>
</li>
<li><p>Push your topic branch up to your fork:</p>
<pre><code class="bash">git push origin &lt;topic-branch-name&gt;
</code></pre>
</li>
<li><p><a href="https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Open a Pull Request</a><br> with a clear title and description.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If you are asked to amend your changes before they can be merged in, please<br>use <code>git commit --amend</code> (or rebasing for multi-commit Pull Requests) and<br>force push to your remote feature branch. You may also be asked to squash<br>commits.</p>
</li>
