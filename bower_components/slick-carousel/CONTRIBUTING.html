<ul>
<li>A test case clearly demonstrates the bug or issue.</li>
<li>It contains the bare minimum HTML, CSS, and JavaScript required to demonstrate the bug.</li>
<li>Assets are not minified (we cannot debug .min.js files).</li>
<li>A link to your production site is <strong>not</strong> a reduced test case.</li>
</ul>
<p>Providing a test case is the best way to get your issue addressed. Without a test case; your issue may be closed.<br>You must provide a clear and simple way to reproduce the issue with the provided fiddle.</p>
<h2 id="Support"><a href="#Support" class="headerlink" title="Support"></a>Support</h2><p>Although Slick is designed to be super easy to use, there’s always things that can go wrong, especially when interacting with other plugins and complicated websites. If you are <strong>having problems getting Slick to work</strong>, or can’t figure something out, <strong>this repository</strong>‘s issues section <strong>is not the place to ask about it</strong>.  </p>
<p>I have set up a subreddit for Slick discussion at <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/slickcarousel/" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reddit.com/r/slickcarousel</a>.<br>And a gitter chatroom here: <a href="https://gitter.im/kenwheeler/slick" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">gitter.im/kenwheeler/slick</a>.<br>And finally you can ask the world for help, and find out if anyone else has your problem at <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/search?q=slick+carousel" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">stackoverflow</a>.</p>
<p>Please use these forums as an area to discuss Slick and any issues you may have.</p>

<h2 id="Pull-requests"><a href="#Pull-requests" class="headerlink" title="Pull requests"></a>Pull requests</h2><p><strong>Contributions are welcome</strong>! That said, please <em>be prepared to edit</em> your pull request at request, and provide a jsFiddle of your fork working interoperably with every “mode” that Slick supports, and with varying numbers of slides, slidesToShow &amp; slidesToScroll. Failure to do so will result in your pull request being closed.</p>
<p><em>Please note that while Slick is open source, this is still my baby, and by submitting a pull request you are authorizing me to edit or modify it in any way shape or form.
